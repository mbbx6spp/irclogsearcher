== Simple IRC log ES importer

Yes, using Awk. How awkward.

After downloading all the plain text IRC logs of format like this:

[source]
----
[14:23] NixOS joined #nixos.
[14:26] <niksnut> heh: I wrote some scripts to build a NixOS configuration (or any other derivation) in a chroot last night
[14:26] <niksnut> I needed it to get some data for a paper
[14:26] <niksnut> namely how long it takes to build a configuration in an empty nix store
[14:31] <civodul> hmm, hello NixOS!
[14:32] <ikwildrpepper> NixOS is a logger
[14:32] <civodul> does it make logs available on-line?
[14:32] <ikwildrpepper> not yet
[14:32] <civodul> would be nice
[14:32] <ikwildrpepper> but will look into that
[14:32] <civodul> cool
[14:33] <niksnut> ikwildrpepper: heh, I should have recognized the IP address :-)
[14:33] <niksnut> can you rename it to NixBot or something?
[14:33] <civodul> +1

You can run the following:

[source]
----
$ awk -f scripts/irclog2json.awk -v date=${DATE} "data/log.${DATE}"
----

It will output JSON like the following:

[source]
----

{ "date": "20141231", "log": [
    { "nick": "devhell", "time": "00:00", "message": "00:00 devhell JagaJaga: Who's your audience?" },

    { "nick": "JagaJaga", "time": "00:02", "message": "00:02 JagaJaga devhell: kmicu: I'm studying with guys who won this lots of times. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest So my audience is computer science students (from the 1st to the last grade)" },
    { "nick": "devhell", "time": "00:03", "message": "00:03 devhell mkay, good luck ;-)" },
    { "nick": "JagaJaga", "time": "00:03", "message": "00:03 JagaJaga kmicu: oxij is going to be there too (if you know him) :D" },
    { "nick": "JagaJaga", "time": "00:04", "message": "00:04 JagaJaga kmicu: he is type theory and nixos addict. So he was the one who suggested me to use this system" },
    { "nick": "JagaJaga", "time": "00:05", "message": "00:05 JagaJaga kmicu: and we have lots of guys who like category theory, type theory, functional languages etc" },

    { "nick": "JagaJaga", "time": "00:06", "message": "00:06 JagaJaga devhell: we have a guy, who won `topcoder` this year" },
    { "nick": "devhell", "time": "00:11", "message": "00:11 devhell JagaJaga: It wouldn't by any chance be Petr Mitrichev?" },
    { "nick": "Fuuzetsu", "time": "00:20", "message": "00:20 Fuuzetsu JagaJaga: yeah, I wouldn't say it's ready for general use yet" },
    { "nick": "Fuuzetsu", "time": "00:20", "message": "00:20 Fuuzetsu we'll get there" },
    { "nick": "Fuuzetsu", "time": "00:20", "message": "00:20 Fuuzetsu and once we do it will be awesome, just not yet ;)" },
    ...
    { "nick": "_", "time": "23:59", "message": "End of day!"}
  ], "message_count": 437}
----

Now you can pipe that into Elasticsearch so you can search the IRC logs. :)
